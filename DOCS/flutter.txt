### Android Studio Dart And Flutter Plugin is not installed ###
$ flutter channel stable 
$ flutter upgrade

Flutter has four release channels: stable, beta, dev, and master. We recommend using the stable channel unless you need a more recent release.

To fix it, go to android studio → preferences → plugins → installed → update your installed flutter plugin

### Installare un pacchetto ###

Now in your Dart code, you can use:
